Connect Sheep is a game about connecting sheep to the internet.

The purpose of the game is to crowd-connect a total of 1 billion sheep. Every sheep connected by each player is added to the global sheep counter that is live on [connectsheep.com](http://www.connectsheep.com)

To connect sheep, people play through different worlds and use different tools like cables, routers and WiFi.

The game is developed for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pandalion.connectsheep) and _iOS (currently unavailable)_ platforms. Press kit at [connectsheep.com/press](http://www.connectsheep.com/press)

Ideas for future: to create an open world community version and to port the game to a browser using a modern JS framework. Looking forward to contributions.
